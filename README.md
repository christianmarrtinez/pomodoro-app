This project is a Pomodoro Timer app designed to help users manage work and break cycles using the Pomodoro Technique. The app features a streamlined funnel: starting at the MenuScreen, users navigate to the CreateSession page, where they can choose preset study (20, 25, or 30 minutes) and break times (5, 10, or 15 minutes) or set custom durations for both. Once times are selected, the Timer page allows users to start, stop, and reset the countdown, with vibration alerts signaling the end of each interval. This app is built with React Native, using Expo for seamless development and vibration functionality.
